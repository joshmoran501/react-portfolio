            Hello, my name is Joshua Moran. I am a MERN stack developer in the
            Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp. I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML
            and CSS, front-end, database, and server-side developments, as well
            as quality assurance and deployment.
          </p>

            I have a Masterâ€™s in Primate Behavior and undergraduate degrees in
            neuroscience and biology, not exactly tech-oriented degrees, right?
            Many of the skills I learned are applicable, however, including
            problem-solving, analyzing data, and effective communication skills.
          </p>

            Outside of work, I am a huge Star Wars fan! I have been collecting
            memorabilia since I was 3 years old and travel around the country to
            attend Star Wars conventions! Also, I am an avid gamer. I play
            mostly shooters and strategy games. Destiny 2 is my favorite game,
            mostly for the social aspects. I have made many great friends
            through Destiny! Finally, I am a big animal lover! My education and
            previous positions have all been centered around primate behavior,
            and while I no longer am in the field, I still love my primates and
            love educating people about them!
